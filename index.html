        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Shivani Swaraj, currently pursuing my Master of Computer
          Applications (MCA). I have a strong interest in web development and
          enjoy creating responsive and user-friendly websites. My technical
          skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap for
          frontend development. I'm also familiar with Git and GitHub for
          version control, and have a solid understanding of Java and SQL for
          backend and database management. I'm always eager to learn new
          technologies and improve my skills through hands-on projects and
          real-world challenges.

          <div class="col-md-3 col-6">
            <img src="Images/HTML.jpeg" class="skills-img" alt="Html" />
            <p>
              HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to
              create and structure content on the web. It forms the backbone of
              all websites by organizing text, images, links, and other elements
              into a readable format for web browsers.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-3 col-6">
            <img src="Images/CSS.jpeg" class="skills-img" alt="CSS" />
            <p>
              CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and visually enhance
              HTML elements on a webpage. It controls the layout, colors, fonts,
              spacing, and overall design to make websites look attractive and
              user-friendly. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying
              styles to them using properties like color, font-size, margin,
              padding, and more. It supports responsive design through media
              queries and allows for consistent styling across multiple pages.
              Learning CSS is essential for creating visually appealing and
              professional-looking websites.
            </p>

          <div class="col-md-3 col-6">
            <img src="Images/Javascript.jpeg" class="skills-img" alt="JavaScript"/>
            <p>
              JavaScript is a powerful scripting language used to make websites
              interactive and dynamic. While HTML structures the content and CSS
              styles it, JavaScript adds functionality—such as form validation,
              animations, interactive buttons, dropdowns, sliders, and much
              more. It runs directly in the browser and allows developers to
              respond to user actions like clicks, typing, or mouse movement.
              JavaScript is an essential part of modern web development and is
              widely used alongside frameworks like React, which help build fast
              and responsive web applications.
            </p>

          <div class="col-md-3 col-6">
            <img src="Images/React.jpeg" class="skills-img" alt="React" />
            <p>
              React is a popular JavaScript library used for building fast and
              dynamic user interfaces, especially for single-page applications.
              Developed by Facebook, React allows developers to create reusable
              components, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
              It uses a virtual DOM for efficient rendering, which improves
              performance and user experience. With React, it's easy to manage
              the state of your application and build responsive interfaces that
              update in real-time without reloading the page. It’s a key tool
              for modern frontend development.

            <img src="Images/Java.jpeg" class="skills-img" alt="Java" />
            <p>
              Java is a versatile and object-oriented programming language that
              is widely used for building web applications, mobile apps, and
              enterprise-level software. It follows the principle of "write
              once, run anywhere," meaning Java applications can run on any
              platform that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In web
              development, Java is often used for server-side programming with
              technologies like Servlets, JSP, and Spring. Its strong typing,
              reliability, and large community support make it a solid choice
              for backend development and scalable applications.

          <div class="col-md-3 col-6"><img src="Images/Sql.jpeg" class="skills-img" alt="Sql" />
            <p>
              SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to
              manage and interact with relational databases. It allows
              developers to store, retrieve, update, and delete data efficiently
              using commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. SQL is
              essential for backend development as it helps in handling
              structured data in applications. It is commonly used with
              databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. Understanding SQL is
              important for creating dynamic web applications that rely on data
              storage and management.

            <img src="Images/Bootstrap.jpeg" class="skills-img" alt="Bootstrap" />
            <p>
              Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that helps developers
              build responsive and mobile-first websites quickly and
              efficiently. It provides a collection of pre-designed HTML, CSS,
              and JavaScript components such as buttons, navigation bars, forms,
              modals, and carousels. Bootstrap uses a grid system to create
              layouts that automatically adjust across different screen sizes,
              making websites look good on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
              It simplifies the web design process and is a great tool for
              beginners to create clean and professional-looking interfaces.

            <p>
              Git is a widely used version control system that helps developers
              track changes in their code and collaborate with others
              effectively. It allows you to save different versions of your
              project, go back to previous states, and work on new features
              without affecting the main codebase. Git is especially useful in
              team environments where multiple people are contributing to the
              same project. With commands like git commit, git push, and git
              pull, developers can manage their code efficiently and avoid
              conflicts. It’s an essential tool for modern software development.

            <p>
              GitHub is a cloud-based platform that works with Git to host and
              manage code repositories. It allows developers to store their
              projects online, collaborate with others, track issues, and
              contribute to open-source projects. GitHub provides features like
              pull requests, branches, and code reviews, making it easy to work
              in teams and manage project versions. It also serves as a
              portfolio of your coding work, where others—including recruiters
              and collaborators—can view your code and contributions. For any
              developer, GitHub is an essential platform to showcase skills and
              collaborate effectively.

                  This is a simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using
                  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a classic two-player game
                  where users take turns placing “X” and “O” on a 3x3 grid. The
                  project focuses on implementing core web development skills
                  such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic using
                  JavaScript. The game checks for a winner after each move and
                  highlights the winning combination. It also includes a reset
                  button to start a new game. This project helped me strengthen
                  my understanding of conditional statements, loops, and UI
                  interaction in JavaScript.

                  The Stopwatch is a web-based time-tracking application built
                  using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes basic features
                  such as Start, Stop, and Reset functions. The timer displays
                  elapsed time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. JavaScript
                  is used to handle the logic for time calculation and button
                  control, while CSS is used to style the layout and make it
                  user-friendly. This project helped me understand how to work
                  with time functions in JavaScript, manage intervals, and
                  create responsive UI components.
